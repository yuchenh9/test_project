# Linework

## About Linework

Linework is a Unity package that allows you to render high-quality outlines and fill effects.

Multiple techniques may be used, balancing visual quality and performance. Both full-screen outlines (for outlined art-styles) and per-object outlines are supported. You can also combine outlines with fill effects such as patterns and overlays. The toolkit is designed to be feature-rich and straightforward to use.

## Quick Start

After importing the asset into Unity, you will be greeted by the support window. In the *Configure* tab, click on the *Detect* button. This will verify that everything is set up correctly in your project. If the support window does not open, you can open it by clicking *Window > Linework > About and Support*.

If the result is showing only green checkmarks, you are good to go! If not, see the [Troubleshooting and Known Limitations](https://linework.ameye.dev/support/troubleshooting-and-known-limitations) section.

To get started, open the *Universal Renderer Data* asset, click on *Add Renderer Feature* and select the outline/fill effect that you would like to add. Each outline effect stores its settings in a separate object that you can create somewhere in your Assets folder, by right-clicking and selecting *Create > Linework > Outline Settings*. 

Drag the created settings into the object slot of the renderer feature. You can now click the *Open* button to open the settings.

By default, the outline should be applied to the whole scene.

Depending on which outline/fill effect you are using, you can find more detailed information about the different configuration options in the [Documentation](https://linework.ameye.dev).

## Samples

There are samples which you can download from the *Package Manager* by clicking *Window > Package Manager*. Then click on the *Linework* package and select the *Samples* tab to import the samples.

The samples include a demo scene showcasing the features of the asset.

## Features

Linework contains multiple renderer features to render outlines and fills.

- **Fast Outline:** Renders outlines by rendering an extruded version of an object behind the original object.
- **Soft Outline:** Renders outlines by generating a silhouette of an object and applying a dilation/blur effect, resulting in smooth, soft-edged contours around objects.
- **Wide Outline:** Renders an outline by generating a signed distance field (SDF) for each object and then sampling it. This creates consistent outlines that smoothly follows the shape of an object.
- **Edge Detection:** Renders outlines by detecting edges and discontinuities within the scene, such as differences in *depth*, *normal vector*, *color*, or *custom input buffers*. This process creates a consistent outline effect that is applied uniformly across the entire scene, making it suitable for both external and internal object boundaries.
- **Surface Fill:** Renders fills by rendering an object with a fill material.

Each effect has an extensive range of settings such as which objects the outline is applied to, the visuals of the outline and the behavior of the outline.

## Compatibility

Linework is compatible with **Unity 6** and the **Universal Render Pipeline**. Other combinations are not supported.
